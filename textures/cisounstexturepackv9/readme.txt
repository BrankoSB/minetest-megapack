	Cisoun's Texture Pack 9


Licence: Do-what-the-fuck-you-want



Special update with some mod's textures replacements. I didn't modified ALL the
textures but most of them. I will surely change the rest later.

Also, I've given up Minetest 0.3 compatibility. It's an old version and I'm lazy 
to rename all the files. /o\


IMPORTANT:
----------
There are two versions of this pack: 

 - 0.4: for early versions of Minetest 0.4.
 	Just copy /0.4/data/* in /minetest/data/ without removing old datas before.

 - git: for latest versions from git.
	Just copy every folder from /dev/ in /minetest/ without removing current
	datas.

Note: all the LUA scripts have been removed so it won't replace those you
already have.
