Change Log for Photorealistic texture packs
-------------------------------------------

2012-08-13: New default sapling texture (does not affect that used for some 
mods).  Brought mesecons support up to date with the new nodebox-based stuff 
(this causes some loss of support for the 0.5 series.  Sorry about that.).

2012-08-10:  Completed adding support for signs mod (files renamed, re-
rendered, added as needed), added support for yard signs.

2012-08-09: Added experimental support for xyz's signs mod - sign texture 
itself only; the text can't be improved yet.

2012-08-06: Added seaweed for flowers mod.  A bit later: Reworked the new 
texture so that it's partially transparent and tiles properly.  This 
necessitated making it look a bit "larger" also, but it works anyway :-)

2012-08-05: Fixed wrong filenames on pipeworks images (result of a change I 
made to the actual mod)

2012-08-01: Added geranium flower.

2012-08-01: Brought UnifiedBricks support up to date.

2012-07-31 (continuing): Water has to have an alpha channel and be partly 
transparent or stuff behind it will show up in front, like clouds.

2012-07-31 (continuing):  Added support for conifers mod.

2012-07-31 (a while later): Brought support for Vessels mod up to date.

2012-07-31: Improved wood texture a bit more, made it look more like planks 
instead of smooth wood.

2012-07-28: Fixed incorrectly-drawn left/right textures for a few homedecor 
blocks, in keeping with having fixed the references therein.

2012-07-26: Brought Unified Dyes support up to date, added support for Vessels 
mod.  Discontinued support for old Madblocks modpack - it's way out of date.  
Still have the images, I'll push them back up later with new names to account 
for Mauvebic's recent changes.

2012-07-19: Added support for my colored woods mod, improved appearance of 
active furnace.

2012-07-17: Added experimental support for wowiamdiamonds' Unified Bricks mod.

2012-07-16 (even later): removed some leftover files from the last gentextures
run on the unifieddyes textures.

2012-07-16 (A bit later): Added support for locked sign mod.

2012-07-16:  Brought support for unifieddyes up-to-date (now 89 colors).

2012-07-14:  Added support for Jordach's older 16-color wool mod.

2012-07-08 (immediately after): Added support for my junglegrass mod.  
Tweaked rotation and position of default jungle grass to center it 
better.

2012-07-08:  Brought support for unifieddyes up-to-date.

2012-07-07 (immediately after): Didn't like the tint I left on clay/clay 
lump.  Reduced both to greyscale in keeping with the game's normal style.

2012-07-07: Recolored clay, gravel, and stone to look more like the 
colors used in the default textures, reworked coal, iron, and all 
moreores minerals to use transparency so they can composite properly on 
top of the stone.  Tweaked active furnace to look hotter, fixed wrong 
filenames, retired 'cooking' variant.

2012-06-30: Shifted torch on ceiling (both static and animated), so that 
base of torch is actually centered.  Created new default door imagery in 
the general style of the game's default texture (but still 
photorealistic of course).  Renamed the previous wood-and-glass door 
imagery for use by my homedecor mod.

2012-06-26: Updated various homedecor dye filenames to accommodate the 
changeover to unifieddyes.

2012-06-23: Brought homedecor support up to date.

2012-06-17: Added support for longer crack/digging animations (now 16 
frames instead of 5), and preliminary support for animated torches, as 
found in the latest git.

2012-06-16 (much later): Enhanced the lava texture, added support for 
animated lava featured in latest git.

2012-06-16 (a bit later): Fixed accidental mirroring of 'folding' doors.

2012-06-16: Added support for my homedecor mod. Adjusted color of 
default_wood to look more like what might be used on a floor or deck and 
to differentiate it from the wood table tops in homedecor (which use the 
original color). Reduced all inventory images in defaults and in all 
mods to max 64px. Re-rendered wooden door and all fence inventory images 
to max 64px also (most were 32px).

2012-06-14: Brought Blox support up to date.

2012-06-03: Fixed a few missing images, added working image for ecube's 
unobtanium mod, added missing blue dye for blox mod. Added support for 
blox and bobblocks mods in C64 pack, brought C64 version up to date re: 
moreblocks.

2012-05-30: Reworked various moreores minerals, default and moreores 
ingots, and a few of the lumps and blocks (shiner, more accurate colors, 
etc.).  Lightened up and re-colored menubg image significantly.  
Improved embossing on larger versions of mese.  Tinted iron apple 
slightly red-brownish (to suggest oxidation/rust).  Reworked grass side 
a bit to improve blending between grass and dirt.  Tweaked color and 
embossing on sandstone.  Fixed stray pixels and missed cuts on default 
swords.  Reworked fireplace wield/inventory image.  Fixed stray pixels 
on larger sizes of flower pot (copy&paste error).  Tweaked larger sizes 
of mesecons 'on' torches (center should have been whited out).

2012-05-29 (almost immediately): Fixed filenames on maptools coins.

2012-05-29: Added support for Bobblocks and Blox mods, brought moreores, 
moreblocks, and maptools support up to date.  Tweaked 32 px maptools 
admin pick, added a few missing 16px maptools textures.  Tweaked default 
rails to better differentiate them from moreores copper rails.  Updated 
filename for current hatches mod (now just hatch.png).

2012-05-27: Added support for maptools, deleted furnace_furnace_* images 
(for a patch that will never happen), renamed some of them and created 
new ones to add support for darkrose's active furnaces patch (which 
*does* exist).  Split all texture packs into separate github 
repositories.

2012-05-16 (even later): deleted github repo and created a new one with 
multiple branches.

2012-05-16 (a bit later): added a few more colors to complete wool mod 
support.  Updated github repo (didn't go through properly last time).

2012-05-16: Fixed a few stray pixels in the pies, scorched stuff and a 
few tools, cleaned up edges of cotton, cotton-in-pot, and cotton (ball), 
fixed slight slight lack of color saturation on chest top, added some 
shading to chest sides to make handles stand out better, reduced noise 
in dirt, grass+dirt side, and alien grass+dirt side, reworked mese, 
faded the color a bit on the paper, broke the repetitive look of the 
papyrus/bamboo, replaced tin and silver lumps with better images 
(actually derived from platinum and osmium), added support for wool mod.  
Updated screenshots.

2012-05-06: Added support for my poison ivy mod.

2012-05-01: Created 32px and 128px versions.  Fixed a few stray pixels 
that snuck in while resizing some images earlier.  Reduced all fence and 
door images meant for the inventory display to max 32x32 (anything more 
is overkill).  Reworked 16px door inventory image slightly.  Reworked 
other door images as well to fix scaling errors.  Reworked mesecons wall 
lever and wall button and wireless devices to improve overall 
appearance.  Reworked 512px "chicken" sign and all 256px and smaller 
signs to fix edge quality.  Reduced menubg to max 128x128px.  Reduced 
treeprop to max 128x128 pixels (both are always displayed small, both 
lower in <128px packs).  Re-introduced 16 px pack - just gotta have it; 
it's a bit more complete than before, but still lacks Madblocks Infra, 
signs, and hydroponics mods.  Reworked unknown block/object/item images.

2012-04-29 (almost immediately): Fixed a few missing 64px and 256px 
images and image credits files.

2012-04-29: Reworked bushes/strawberry "tree" a bit, renamed a bunch of 
files and added a few more to bring Madblocks up to date (also adds good 
support for power lines/utilities).  Retired the 16px texture pack from 
distribution - it just isn't good enough.

2012-04-26 (a bit later): Removed Tron flowers from regular distribution 
(they're no longer used but I'll keep them locally just in case). 
Replaced previous-removed hydroponics images with better ones that won't 
make you itch. ;-)

2012-04-26: Deleted all vine-like images related to the hydroponics mod.  
I accidentally used a base plant that is most definitely NOT suitable 
for eating - poison ivy!  Will replace the missing images shortly.

2012-04-25 (a bit later): Reduced menu background image in 512px pack to 
256x256 (it's always displayed at 128x128 pixels, so this still provides 
some future-proofing).  Reduced half heart to 32x32 in 64/256/512px 
packs to match full heart.  Added support for particles mod (64px and up 
only, all images are 49x49px in all cases).

2012-04-25: reworked moreblocks/rope to look more like the sort of 
swinging vines/ropes seen in movies and such (left the ones for the 
vines modpack alone).  Renamed a few files and added a bunch more to add 
support for hydroponics mod (64px and above only).

2012-04-24: reworked all magic lantern images in all packs; on a 
revisit, I decided that the dithering to simulate translucency just 
doesn't work, so I undid the dithering and flattened them all against a 
dim yellow background.  Fixed an alpha error that snuck in while making 
the nether "portal stuff" object, reduced 64px and 512px hearts to 32 px 
each since they'll likely never need to be be drawn any larger than that 
anyway (or probably over 16x16 for that matter).  Created a complete 
256px version of the pack.

2012-04-22 (even later): Duplicate default_furnace_front.png to a 
different filename for use by the active furnaces mod.

2012-04-22 (a bit later): Replaced active/cooking furnace with a set of 
images to add support for lkjoel's active furnaces mod (WIP).

2012-04-22: Tweaked 16px furnace a bit.  Added images for half heart and 
active/cooking furnace.

2012-04-21: Reworked moreores/gold ore, added support for nether mod.  
Re-uploaded with 16px support for nether (same filename)

2012-04-20 (a bit later): Reworked cooked rat (too many copy&paste 
artifacts).  Added support for spotlights mod.

2012-04-20: Reworked default_brick slightly, fixed outdated filenames on 
moreores/mithril ore and cooked rat, reconfigured, renamed, and added a 
whole bunch of textures to bring pack up to date with transition from 
Moreblocks-OCD to Madblocks: this update adds support for all mods in 
that set, except only partial support for infrastructure mod (only the 
"street builder" object, 64px and larger sizes only), and signs mod 
(64px and up only; 16px is just too low of a resolution to retain enough 
detail).  Tweaked 16px default glass to match the various similar glow 
glass objects.

2012-04-15 (even later): Brightened up and reworked railroad tracks to 
improve quality and tiling.  Reworked all mesecons wires and objects 
bearing them to improve tiling.  Neither category of images was rendered 
symmetrically, so they tiled weird at some rotations.  Updated relevant 
screenshot.

2012-04-15 (a bit later): reworked default and cherry blossom trees (and 
tops) to use more accurate textures.  Note to self: if it bears apples, 
it's probably an apple tree, and if it has cherry blossoms, it's 
probably a cherry blossom tree. ;-) Also updated the screenshots.

2012-04-15: re-rendered mesecon wires, reworked many mesecons to use the 
new renders, fixed missing alpha channel on terra_redgrass_side and on a 
couple of ores, fixed colors in treeprop to better match default_leaves, 
fixed a couple of oversized images in 64x version (copy&paste error), 
added partial mesecon wires and wire "central nodes" for possible future 
use, fixed missing wall buttons and bouleau trees in 64px version, 
created complete 16px version.

2012-04-13 (even later): renamed mesecons 'torch' and 'lamp' series and 
a few others, and added a bunch of new imagery to bring support for that 
mod up to date (there were lots of changes upstream that I hadn't 
accounted for).

2012-04-13 (a bit later): added missing arrow images for throwing mod, 
added missing credits for a few images.

2012-04-13: added imagery for growing trees cherry blossom mod.

2012-04-12 (even later): added imagery for nature pack mods.

2012-04-12 (a bit later): turned straight railroad tracks around the 
right way, updated screenshots.

2012-04-12: added (default) wooden doors.

2012-04-11 (a bit later): added fire, desert stone, desert sand, dry 
shrub in keeping with recent minetest update.

2012-04-11: removed alpha from water, re-rendered stone brick.  Added 
imagery for moreblocks "OCD extension", flowers, terra, growing trees 
alien, and growing trees bouleau mods.

2012-04-09 (even later): added imagery for magic lantern mod, based on 
the author's concept/test images.

2012-04-09 (a bit later): created a 64x64 pixel version.

2012-04-09: thickened vines, re-rendered sand and sandstone, and tweaked 
ladder and a few others to improve tiling and stacking, tweaked 
tree/jungle tree tops to better flow from the sides, darkened/increased 
saturation on mithril block, added beveled edges to bookshelves, furnace 
front and sides, hatch, many mesecons blocks.

2012-04-08: fixed missing alpha channels on default_grass_side and 
various ores.

2012-04-06: initial upload of 512px version for testing.
