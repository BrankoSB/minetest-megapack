This texture pack aims to create a realistic environment for Minetest.  
All images herein are derived either from photographs found on Wikipedia 
and other distribution-friendly sites, or from my or my husband's own 
photography, or from renderings made with Inkscape and The GIMP.

Put the Vanessa_* folder wherever you want to keep your texture packs, 
and edit ~/.minetest/minetest.conf to point to it.

See image-credits.txt for more information on exactly where the images 
came from.
