Textures:

 I couldn't find the specific author of the Iron apple texture, but suspect it was cisoun, because of what is stated in the minetest wiki: http://wiki.minetest.com/wiki/Texture_Packs/Cisoun.

As being part of the main game (from minetest_game's readme.txt):

Description
----------------------------------

Provides a craftable iron apple like the one that was at least part of the main games 0.2, 0.3.0, 0.3.1 and 0.3.2 (content_craft.cpp), 
but moved to the legacy mod with the start of the 0.4 series.

In the 0.4 versions it is only accessible by /giveme and not eatable.

As Lua mod ironapple once again the iron apple is craftable and eatable during gameplay as it was under 0.2, 0.3.0, 0.3.1 and 0.3.2
