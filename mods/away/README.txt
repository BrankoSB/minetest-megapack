Description:

Set yourself as away using the server command
  /away
You can also give a reason, as follows:
  /away Saving the princess

Each time somebody mentions your nick, the server will print a message
that you are currently away (however, not more than once per minute).

You can set yourself as no longer away with another /away, or by talking. If somebody tried to talk to you while you were away, the server will inform everyone that you're back. Doing something else
in-game (e.g. moving around, digging, building, etc.) does not reset the away status.

You can check your current away status:
  /away?
You can also check any other player's status:
  /away? name

Note: an away reason is hidden in case the user in question is missing the 'shout' privilege.
