Mod Animals adds self moving, harvestable, killable, breeding and fighting animals to minetest.
If anyone can provide better graphics (where I only placed dummy's) I gladly add them ;-)
You'll find some templates within template folder!

TODO:
-names for remaining 2 fishes
-improove documentation
-more sounds

Note: 1.2.90 is a beta release movement generation has been reorganized quite a lot, expect BUGS!
-animalmaterials has been reintegrated you don't need to download it separatly
