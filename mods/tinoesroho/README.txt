Introducing AuTomated trader! 

Tinoesroho's AuTomated traders make life more interesting - from exchanging raw resources for coins to purchasing useful materials, they are an indispensable part of life in the world of Minetest. Be careful, though: these can't handle stacks properly!
To trade, simply whack with a single node of the type you'd like to exchange - not the entire stack, unless you like getting underpaid! I've added support for the moreores mod, so, whack away!
Update expected in ~2 weeks.


Here cometh the Leafblower!

This baby removes leaves, cacti and other vermin in a large radius. Based on nuke, it's a little laggy, but gets the job done. If ya feel it's a little too powerful , simply edit the range in init.lua
Use with care - the World Wildlife Foundation might not like you removing forests willy-nilly!
