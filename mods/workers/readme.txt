HOW TO USE WORKER
-----------------

1. Harvey The Harvester:
Put in on the ground and right click. Enter the item name that you want it to collect (you can write modname:nodename or alias). Left click to activate, left click it again to stop it and take it and everything it has collected into your inventory.

2. Mordec The Miner:
Put in on the ground and right click. Place some default:wood into the wood slot at top left corner. Left click to activate, left click it again to stop it. For each level of ground it digs, it will consume one wood. Right click to open its inventory.

3. Garren The Gardener:
Put in on the ground and right click. Place one plant sample into the top left slot and put some default:sapling into the top right slot. Left click to activate, left click it again to stop it.

For each jungletree it grows, it will consume 9 saplings.
For each papyrus or cactus it grows, it will consume 3 saplings.
For each junglegrass or dry shrub it grows, it will consume one sapling.

If there is no plant sample or the sample is not one of the plants mentioned above, it will plant a sapling, and that of course will use one sapling each.
