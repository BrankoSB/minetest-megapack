Description:

As I felt it was lacking, I made a simple mod to add "bedrock" to minetest, a stone that you can't destroy.

Notes:
  - Using this mod together with mods like Moreores or Gemstones may lead to ores being placed at the bedrock layer. If this happens, please tell me if putting the name of the other mod into depends.txt helps.
  - I will not announce new versions when I release them, but you can always find the version history (with previous versions) above.
