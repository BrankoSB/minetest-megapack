This mod adds more tools to minetest.
*universal groan*
Well, not only are they faster, they look larger when in player's hand.
Big thanks go to VanessaE(for helping me understand loops in lua) and Calinou(for making moreores, which the loop that registers all these tools is based off of.).
Dependancies: default mod, workbench mod. Optional are moreores and gloopores, which sized-up tools for those are also registered. (For moreores and gloopores, only materials that make tools in those mods make tools in this mod.)
If you want me to add tools from more mods, just tell me.
