Readme file for Lava mod [lava] v0.1
details:
Version: v0.1
License (code): LGPL
Code derived from Minetest defaults, and VanessaE's Flower mod (spawning lava above lava)
Information:
This mod adds some ABM's and stuff that makes lava rise/spread. Currently, for lava to rise, 
it must be in the center of a 3x3 region of lava sources, with 4 air blocks above the center (spawns 
one lava source above the center of that 3x3 area). Also, to keep the lava rising, some random 
flowing lava nodes will turn into lava sources. Without this, the number of lava sources per next 
''level'' will decline slowly until there aren't enough left to make the lava keep rising.
It is recommended that you do not install this mod in servers (yet) as I plan to add special 
types of lava that are the only ones that ''rise'' (also the viscosity will be changed for 
dferent types of lava)
----------------
it is best to also install Rath's Cooling Lava mod (http://minetest.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2709), 
if you want real-ish volcanoes (currently only shield-type volcanoes are created, in the future there 
will be ''thicker'' lava that will help make more types of volcanoes/rifts) and this is why Rath's 
cooling lava mod is in depends.txt.
